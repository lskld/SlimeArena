<p>Slime Arena is a test project that we, the creators (@lskld / @AlexanderFennell), are developing as a way to learn simple game development in Unity & C#.</p>
<p>The main focus of the game is to make it into a functioning 2D arena shooter, where the player, (a slime named Håkan), shoots enemy slimes in order to progress through the games levels and stages.
As of now, we are still working on the core mechanics of the game and learning as we go. </p>
<h3>Disclamer! The game is in early stages of development, and core functions and gameplay mechanics have not been fully implemented yet. Our current focus is on developing working game systems rather than design. Many of the current sprites are temporary.</h3>
